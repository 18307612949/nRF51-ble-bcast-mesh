= nRF51-ble-broadcast-mesh

Bluetooth Low Energy based Rebroadcasting mesh implementation on the nRF51.
Works with Softdevice S110 v7.x with Timeslot API.
Offers an API for implementing your own mesh enabled application, operating
concurrently with regular BLE applications.

== Usage
In addition to two provided examples, there is a template project under
_examples/_. This may be used as a basis for your own applications, or you
could choose to do it yourself from scratch. In theory, the framework should be
compatible with most Softdevice based projects, but some restrictions to
hardware and software modules apply, see <<resource-allocation>> for details.
The framework adds a Mesh GATT service to the Softdevice GATT server which
contain all mesh-global states. This service may be accessed by external nodes,
just as any other GATT service, through a connection established via the
Softdevice. See section <<gatt-service>> for details about structure and
access. 

== Basic concepts

A rebroadcasting mesh network works by flooding all messages to all nodes 
in the network through broadcasts. Each time a device receives a broadcast
message from some other device in the mesh, it repeats the message, or 
_rebroadcasts_ it, letting its neighbors hear the new message. 
The neighbors rebroadcast the message to their neighbors, and the process
is repeated until all devices in the mesh have received the message. This 
lets wireless devices talk to eachother without being within direct radio 
range, as devices between them help relaying the messages.

The Rebroadcasting Mesh framework (hereby referred to as "the framework" or
rbc_mesh) provides a connection-less, rebroadcasting infrastructure for
synchronizing states across a set of BLE enabled nodes. All nodes receive all
messages that are transmitted within their range, and any node may update the
mesh-global states. There is no hierarchy, and no directed data links. 

The framework resides on top of the nRF51 Softdevice, utilizing the Timeslot
API to allocate radio time. The framework will attempt to allocate as much time
as possible, in order to listen for other nodes' messages.

All nodes in the mesh share a set of indexed dataslots. The data contained at each
index is propagated through the mesh with version numbers, with the objective of 
synchronizing the same version of the data across all nodes in the mesh. Each 
time a node overwrites a value, it increments the version number, and all nodes 
that receive a broadcast message with a version number that is higher than the 
one in its database, will adapt this new version of the value. 

The value propagation is controlled by an implementation of the IETF RFC6206
"Trickle", a flood control algorithm for lossy, low power networks. The Trickle
algorithm dynamically decides intervals at which a value will be broadcasted by
a node, based on how many consistent messages the node picks up, and when the last
update to the state it manages was. The Trickle algorithm dynamically adapts to
node density and value update frequency.

The framework provides each handle-value pair with one Trickle-instance (an
isolated version of the algorithm), and utilizes the Softdevice GATT server
structure to store the values. All values are stored as characteristics within
one "Mesh"-GATT Service, which is accessible to external nodes through a
classic BLE Softdevice connection, implemented in application space. The "BLE
Gateway example" displays a way to achieve such behavior.

== Structure
The project is split into two parts: _rbc_mesh/_ (the framework), and a folder with
examples. The framework is interfaced through a set of API functions,
exclusively contained in the _rbc_mesh.h_ file. 

image::docs/architecture.png[Framework modules]

=== Framework Modules
The framework is split into several separate modules, each of which is
responsible for managing various aspects of the framework.

* *rbc_mesh* The top module of the framework, contains all API functions and is
the only module that should be accessed by the application.

* *mesh_srv* The value storage module, communicates with the Softdevice's GATT
server, and maps all handles to GATT characteristics.

* *timeslot_handler* A module communicating with and abstracting the nRF51
Softdevice Timeslot API and manages the two interrupt contexts the framework
runs in.

* *trickle* Implementation of the IETF RFC6206 "Trickle" algorithm for
mesh-global state propagation.

* *transport_control* Lower level packet handler. Abstracts the radio interface and
packet format for the mesh_srv-module. 

* *radio_control* Asynchronous radio abstraction. Offers a way for higher level
modules to queue radio events and packets, and also provides callbacks on
various radio events.

* *timer_control* Interfaces the NRF_TIMER0 hardware module by managing timer
capture allocations and callbacks. Tightly integrated with the radio module.

=== API

The API is exclusively contained in the _rbc_mesh.h_ file in _rbc_mesh/_, and
while the other framework files need to be included in the build process or
Keil project, they should not be interfaced directly. Note that all API
functions except the getters for metadata calls Softdevice SVC functions, and
consequently, all use of the API must happen in interrupt context APP_LOW or MAIN. 
The framework event callback function runs in priority 3 (APP_LOW), and it is
safe to use the API from this context.

==== The API provides the following functions to the user:

*Initialize framework*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_init(rbc_mesh_init_params_t init_params);
        
----
This function must be called before any other framework function, and sets up
the Mesh GATT service and enables listening for incoming mesh messages.

The parameters to this function are collected in a struct defined in
_rbc_mesh.h_.

All nodes within the same mesh network must be set up with the same access
address, channel, radio mode and packet configuration, but handle_count and 
adv_int_ms may be different. 

'''

*Manually enable broadcasting of a given value*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_value_enable(uint8_t handle);
----
Start broadcasting the indicated value to other nodes, without updating the
contents of the value. If the handle-value pair has never been used before, the
framework forces the node to broadcast an empty version 0-message to
other nodes, which, in turn will answer with their version of the
handle-value-pair. This way, new nodes may get up to date with the rest of the
nodes in the mesh.

'''

*Disable broadcasting of a given value*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_value_disable(uint8_t handle);
----
Stop broadcasting the indicated handle-value pair. Note that the framework will
keep updating the local version of the variable when external nodes write to
it, and consequently notify the application about the update as usual. The
framework will not, however, rebroadcast the value to other nodes, but rather
take a passive role in the mesh for this handle-value pair.

'''

*Update value*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_value_set(uint8_t handle, uint8_t* data, uint16_t len);
----
Update the value represented by the given handle. This will bump the version
number on the handle-value pair, and broadcast this new version to the rest of
the nodes in the mesh. 

The `data` array may at most be 28 bytes long, and an error will be returned if
the len parameter exceeds this limitation.

'''

*Get value*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_value_get(uint8_t handle, 
    uint8_t* data, 
    uint16_t* len,
    ble_gap_addr_t* origin_addr);
----
Returns the most recent value paired with this handle. The `data` buffer must
be at least 28 bytes long in order to ensure memory safe behavior. The actual
length of the data is returned in the `length` parameter. The `origin_addr`
parameter returns the address of the node that first started broadcasting the
current version of the message.

'''

*Get operational access address*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_access_address_get(uint32_t* access_address);
----
Returns the access address specified in the initialization function in the
`access_address` parameter.

'''

*Get operational channel*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_channel_get(uint8_t* channel);
----
Returns the channel specified in the initialization function in the
`channel` parameter.

'''

*Get handle count*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_handle_count_get(uint8_t* handle_count);
----
Returns the handle count specified in the initialization function in the
`handle_count` parameter. 

'''

*Get minimum advertisement interval*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_adv_int_get(uint32_t* adv_int_ms);
----
Returns the minimum advertisement interval specified in the initialization
function in the `adv_int_ms` parameter. 

'''

*BLE event handler*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_ble_evt_handler(ble_evt_t* evt);
----
Softdevice BLE event handler. Must be called by the application if the
softdevice function `sd_ble_evt_get()` returns a new event. This will update
version numbers and transmit data if any of the value-characteristics in the
mesh service has been written to through an external softdevice connection. May
be omitted if the application never uses any external connections through the
softdevice.

'''

*Softdevice event handler*
[source,c]
----
uint32_t rbc_mesh_sd_irq_handler(void);
----
Handles and consumes any pure softdevice events (excluding softdevice BLE
        events. See the official
        https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/docs/[Softdevice documentation] for
        details). Should be called on each call to `SD_IRQHandler()`.

==== Return values
All API functions return a 32bit status code, as defined by the nRF51 SDK. All 
functions will return `NRF_SUCCESS` upon successful completion, and all
functions except the `rbc_mesh_init()` function return
`NRF_ERROR_INVALID_STATE` if the framework has not been initialized. All
possible return codes for the individual API functions (and their meaning)
are defined in the `rbc_mesh.h` file. 

==== Framework events
In addition to the provided API functions, the framework provides an event
queue for the application. These events are generated in the framework and
should be handled by the application in an implementation of the
`rbc_mesh_event_handler()` function defined in _rbc_mesh.h_. The events come in
the shape of `rbc_mesh_event_t*` structs, with an event type, a handle number,
    a data array and an originator address.

The framework may produce the following events:

* *Update*: The value addressed by the given handle has been updated from an
external node with the given address, and now contains the data array
provided in the event-structure.

* *Conflicting*: A value with the same version number, but different data or
originator has arrived at the node, and this new, conflicting value is provided
within the event-structure. The value is *not* overwritten in the database, but
the application is free to do this with a call to `rbc_mesh_value_set()`.

* *New*: The node has received an update to the indicated handle-value pair,
which was not previously active.

=== Examples

The project contains two simple examples and one template project. The two
examples are designed to operate together, and show off an extremely simple
example scenario where two handle-value pairs decides the state of the two LEDs
on the nRF51 evkit (or red and green LED on the nRF51 dongle). The examples
have been tested with boards PCA10000, PCA10001, PCA10031 and PCA10003.

The template provides a basis for implementing your own applications with the
framework, and addresses the different eventhandlers and initialization
functions, without any additional functionality.

==== LED Mesh example
This example reads the buttons on the nRF51 evkit boards, and sets the LEDs
accordingly. It also broadcasts the state of the LEDs to the other nodes in the
same mesh, which will copy the state of the node that registered a button push.
This example can also be flashed to the nRF51 dongles (PCA10000 and PCA10031), 
even though these boards don't have any GPIO actions enabled. The dongle-nodes 
will act as active slaves, copying and rebroadcasting the LED states of other 
nodes.

==== BLE Gateway example
This example uses the same configuration for LEDs as the LED Mesh example, but
provides a S110 Softdevice profile for communication with external nodes in
stead of a physical interface. The example application starts sending
regular connectable BLE advertisements with the Softdevice, and displays the
Mesh service in its GATT server, so that external nodes may write to the two
LED config values as if they were regular characteristics. 

== How it works
=== GATT Service
All values are stored as separate characteristics in the Softdevice GATT server. These
characteristics are all contained within one "Mesh" GATT service, along with
one metadata characteristic containing information about the state of the mesh.

The GATT service and characteristics operate with their own 128 bit base UUID,
with the same base.  

.Assigned UUIDs
|===
|Value | UUID 

|Mesh service | 0x2A1E0001-FD51-D882-8BA8-B98C0000CD1E
|Mesh metadata characteristic | 0x2A1E0002-FD51-D882-8BA8-B98C0000CD1E
|Mesh value characteristic | 0x2A1E0003-FD51-D882-8BA8-B98C0000CD1E
|===

==== Mesh values
The Mesh value characteristics are the states that will be shared across the
mesh. Each Mesh value may contain up to 28 bytes of data, and be updated from any
node in the mesh. 

There may be up to 155 "Mesh value" characteristics in the mesh service in each
node, depending on configuration parameters provided to the `rbc_mesh_init()`
function at runtime. Each mesh value will operate with their own instance of
the Trickle algorithm, meaning that they will be rebroadcasted independently.
The handles addressing the values are stored as standard https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/Pages/GattNamespaceDescriptors.aspx[Bluetooth SIG
namespace descriptors], where the enumeration of each value is used as
a mesh-global handle.

_NOTE:_ Because the Bluetooth SIG has defined namespace descriptor 0 as
"unknown", the handles start at 1, and trying to access handle 0 returns an
NRF_ERROR_INVALID_ADDR error.

==== Mesh metadata
For ease of use, the service also provides a Metadata characteristic, providing
configuration parameters for the mesh. This meatadata characteristic may be
read by external nodes, and used for configuring new nodes that the user wishes
to add to the mesh. The Metadata characteristic is structured as follows:

[cols="3,1,1,6", options="Header"]
.Metadata Characteristic Structure
|===
|Value | Position | Size | Description

|Access Address | 0 | 4 bytes | The Access address the mesh operates on. 
|Advertisement interval | 4 | 4 bytes | The minimum advertisement interval each value
is broadcasted with in milliseconds.
|Value count | 8 | 1 byte | The amount of available value slots on the node
|Channel | 9 | 1 byte | The BLE channel the mesh operates on
|===



=== Trickle Algorithm
The Trickle Algorithm was first presented by P. Levis of Stanford University
and T. Clausen of LIX, Ecole Polytechnique in March 2010, and has since seen
several revisions until it was published as RFC6202 in March 2011. The Trickle
Algorithm provides a method of controlled packet flooding across a mesh of
low-power lossy network nodes, by letting the nodes dynamically decide when to
broadcast their values based on network activity and when the last update to
state values arrived. 

==== A brief overview
The algorithm operate in exponentially growing time intervals of size I, starting at
interval size Imin, growing up to Imax. During an interval, it registers all
incoming messages, where each message may be either consistent or inconsistent
with the nodes current state (the definition of consistency is left for the 
user to decide). For each consistent message, a counter value, C is increased
by one, and for each inconsistent message, if the interval size I is larger
than Imin, the interval timer is reset, and I is set to Imin. At the start of
each interval, a timer T is set for a random time in the range `[I/2, I)`. When
this timer expires, the node shall broadcast its state if the consistent
message counter C is less than some redundancy constant K. At the end of each
interval, the interval length (I) is doubled if `I * 2 < Imax`, and C is reset.

The exponential growth and insconsistency reset functionality allows the nodes
in the network to grow exponentially more silent as the state remains
unchanged, but still stays responsive, as new information arrives. The
consistency counter C and redundancy constant K allows the system to
dynamically adjust to network density, as nodes will choose not to transmit if
they've heard the same message from other nodes several times.

==== Usage in the framework
The framework provides one instance of the Trickle Algorithm for each handle
value pair (dubbed a Trickle instance). This means that when one value is frequently updated, while another
one remains unchanged, the node only rebroadcasts the active value frequently,
keeping the interval times for the static value high. Each handle-value pair
also comes with a version number, which increases by one for each fresh write
to a value. This version number, along with a checksum allows the framework to
distinguish value consistency. If the node recevies a value update with a
higher version number than its own, it will automatically overwrite the
contents of the value data and notify the user. Any inconsistencies to both
version number and checksum results in a reset of interval timing for the value
in question. 

==== Weaknesses in algorithm and implementation
While the algorithm in its intended form provides a rather robust and
effective packet propagation scheme, some necessary adjustments introduces a
few weaknesses. First off, using several instances of the algorithm on the same
set of nodes yields a growth in on-air collisions and poorer frequency
utilization control, as the individual instances take no consideration to
the others' activity. This means that the scheme doesn't scale that well with
several handle value pairs, and the user is asked to consider this during
implementation. The choice of doing separate trickle instances is, however a
result of a tradeoff: If the entire node state shared one trickle instance, the
entire state would be rebroadcasted each time a part of it is updated, 
and the amount of shareable data would be severely limited by packet size and
packet chaining possibilities.

Another weakness in the adaption is caused by the fact that the Softdevice Timeslot API
won't let the framework get free access to the radio at all times, resulting in
a reduced on-air time for mesh related operations. When the
Softdevice operates in an advertising state, this problem only has an impact of
5-25% reduction in potential on-air time for mesh operations, but in a
connected state with a short connection interval, the Softdevice may reduce
timeslots by as much as 80%. This results in a lot of missed packets to the
affected node, and may dramatically increase propagation time to this
node. 

=== Timeslots
The framework does all mesh-related transmissions in timeslots granted by the
Softdevice Multiprotocol Timeslot API, operating directly on the radio hardware
module. Timeslots are primarily allocated by extending, short timeslots into
timeslots of upto 1 second, and the framework will attempt to seize the radio 
for as much as the Softdevice will allow. At the beginning of each timeslot, 
the framework samples the RTC0 Low Frequency Timer, and checks whether any 
timers related to the Trickle Algorithm have expired since the end of the 
previous timeslot. If this is the case, the framework does all pending 
operations immediately. After this initial "catch up" operation, the framework 
handles all operations as they appear for the remainder of the timeslot.

For details about the Softdevice Multiprotocol Timeslot API, plese refer to the
Softdevice Specification, available on the Nordic Semiconductor homepage.

=== Air interface packets
All Mesh-related packets are broadcasted as regular BLE Nonconnectable
Advertisements, with a few differences: The Access address is set by the user,
and does not have to match the Bluetooth Specification advertisement access
address. In addition, the Advertisement Address (GAP address) field provided after
the packet header, does not necessarily contain the Advertisement Address of
the node broadcasting the message, but rather the address of the mesh node at
which the indicated version of the value-handle pair first appeared. The
packet structure is illustrated below.

image::docs/packet_format.png[Packet format on air]

=== Resource allocation
The framework takes control over several hardware and software resources,
making these unavailable to applications:

* *Timeslot API* All callbacks for timeslot sessions are held by the framework,

* *SWI0_IRQ* The Software interrupt is used for asynchronous packet processing 

* *NRF_TIMER0* HF timer 0 is reset and started by the Timeslot API at the
beginning of each timeslot, and all capture compare slots for this timer may be
in use at any time

* *NRF_RTC0* The Timeslot API uses RTC0 for timing, and manipulating this
module will lead to undefined behavior or hardfaults in the Softdevice.

* *NRF_PPI, channels 8-12* The framework uses PPI channel 8-12 for radio
operation during timeslots, and the Softdevice may use channels 8+ outside them. Only
channels 0-7 are safely available to the application (just as with regular
 Softdevice applications).

In addition, the Softdevice may block some hardware blocks not listed here.
Please refer to the relevant Softdevice Specification for details (available at
the Nordic Semiconductor homepage).

==== Memory
The framework allocates a metadata array on the heap, with 36bytes per
handle-value pair. The rest of the program operates strictly on the stack, and
compiled at Optimization level -O0, Keil reports a program size of approx.
10kB, and stack size of 5.5kB for the Template project under `examples/`.

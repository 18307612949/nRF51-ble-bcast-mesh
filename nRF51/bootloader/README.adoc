= Bootloader Alpha

This is the first preview release of the mesh-dfu-bootloader, which is in development.
When finished, the bootloader is meant to perform a concurrent DFU transfer for all potential target nodes across a mesh network.


== Current status
The bootloader works with a serial connection over USB (Baud1000000, 8n1, RTS/CTS), and follows the packet format described in the reference documentation under /docs/dfu. It is currently able to flash and reboot to an application, but has not been tested for SD or Bootloader transfer.
